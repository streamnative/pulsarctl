# How to use pulsarctl context

In multi-cluster, **context** is a very interesting and useful function. It can help users cache information of multiple clusters, and can switch between multiple clusters.

The feature will be support in v0.3.0 of pulsarctl.

## Define contexts and auth info

Suppose you have two clusters, one for development work and one for scratch work. In the `development` cluster, the broker service URL is `http://1.2.3.4:8080`, the bookie service URL is `http://1.2.3.4:8083`. In your `scratch` cluster, the broker service URL is `http://5.6.7.8:8080`, the bookie service URL is `http://5.6.7.8:8083`.

Now, you can use `set` of context to define your cluster, the command as follows:

```bash
$ pulsarctl context set development --admin-service-url="http://1.2.3.4:8080" --bookie-service-url="http://1.2.3.4:8083"
$ pulsarctl context set scratch --admin-service-url="http://5.6.7.8:8080" --bookie-service-url="http://5.6.7.8:8083"
```

Then you can use the following command check content of `pulsar`:

```bash
$ cat $HOME/.config/pulsar
```

The content of pulsar as follows:

```text
auth-info:
  development:
    locationoforigin: $HOME/.config/pulsar
    tls_trust_certs_file_path: ""
    tls_allow_insecure_connection: false
    token: ""
    tokenFile: ""
  scratch:
    locationoforigin: $HOME/.config/pulsar
    tls_trust_certs_file_path: ""
    tls_allow_insecure_connection: false
    token: ""
    tokenFile: ""
contexts:
  development:
    admin-service-url: http://1.2.3.4:8080
    bookie-service-url: http://1.2.3.4:8083
  scratch:
    admin-service-url: http://5.6.7.8:8080
    bookie-service-url: http://5.6.7.8:8083
current-context: ""
```

If you want to `set` the auth info, you can specify the following flags:

- `--token`
- `--token-file`
- `--tls-trust-cert-path`
- `--tls-allow-insecure`

## Set the current context

When you define the info of cluster in `$HOME/.config/pulsar`, you can quickly switch between clusters by using the following command(suppose you want to use scratch cluster):

```bash
$ pulsarctl context use scratch
```

Now, you are using the context and auth info of `scratch`. And you can validate the current context value by using `pulsarctl context current`.

If you don't know the current names of cluster, you can use the following command:

```bash
$ pulsarctl context get
```

The output as follows:

```text
+---------+-------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| CURRENT |    NAME     | BROKER SERVICE URL  | BOOKIE SERVICE URL  |
+---------+-------------+---------------------+---------------------+
|         | development | http://1.2.3.4:8080 | http://1.2.3.4:8083 |
|   *     | scratch     | http://5.6.7.8:8080 | http://5.6.7.8:8083 |
+---------+-------------+---------------------+---------------------+
```

## Rename the context

For some reason, we defined the name of the current context incorrectly. If you want to modify the name, you can use the following command:

```bash
$ pulsarctl context rename old_name new_name
```

## Delete the context

If the current cluster information is invalid, you want to delete it(suppose the cluster name is `scratch`), you can use the following command:

```bash
$ pulsarctl context delete scratch
```
